      <h1>Welcome to Dmitry Mamyrev's Blog!</h1>
      <p>
      Hi, I'm Dmitry Mamyrev, a JavaScript developer with over 10 years of experience. My work has primarily focused on the Vue.js framework, but I've also worked with Angular and React. I'm passionate about problem-solving and constantly exploring ways to improve development processes, enhance productivity, and create an indistractable work environmentâ€”especially with tools like Vim and the state of flow.
      </p>


      <p>
      I have a deep interest in Linux and open-source software, both of which fuel my passion for innovation and learning. I enjoy staying up-to-date on global events and exploring new ideas. My hobbies include playing chess, reading, and making jokes, and I value creativity, responsibility, and honesty in all aspects of life.
      </p>

      <p>
      In this blog, I share my thoughts on coding, open-source, productivity hacks, and more. If you're a fellow developer or curious about any of these topics, I hope you'll find value here. Let's learn and build together!
